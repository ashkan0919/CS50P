My solutions to the problem sets presented in **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python**.

For more information on this course, see: [EDx HarvardX CS50P](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home) & [Harvard OpenCourseWare CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

### Quick Setup: Working Environment

To quickly set up a local working environment containing `style50`, `check50`, and `submit50` simply open a terminal in your working directory and run `pipenv install check50 submit50 style50`. This will create a virtual environment which you can access using: `pipenv shell`. From there you can issue all necessary ___*50___ commands. If you don't have `pipenv` installed, simply run `pip3 install pipenv`.

<sub>Please see [Pipenv's Documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org/) for more info.</sub>

### Important Note: Academic Honesty Policy

Please do not try to submit my answers as your own.

>Note that CS50â€™s staff audits submissions to CS50P. Students found to be in violation of the Academic Honesty policy will be removed from the course and deemed ineligible for a certificate.
