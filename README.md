### Quick Setup: Working Environment

To quickly set up a local working environment containing `style50`, `check50`, and `submit50` simply open a terminal in your working directory and run `pipenv install check50 submit50 style50`. This will create a virtual environment which you can access using: `pipenv shell`. From there you can issue all necessary ___*50___ commands. If you don't have `pipenv` installed, simply run `pip3 install pipenv`.
